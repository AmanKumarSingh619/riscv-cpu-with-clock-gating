### ðŸ”¹ What is Clock Gating?  
Clock gating is a **power-saving technique** used in digital circuits to disable the clock signal for **inactive components**, reducing dynamic power consumption. Instead of continuously toggling unused flip-flops and registers, clock gating **stops the clock when a circuit is not in use**, saving energy.

### ðŸ”¹ How We Implemented Clock Gating  
In this RISC-V CPU design, clock gating is applied to **registers and pipeline stages** to reduce switching power:  
âœ… A **clock gating cell** is inserted before registers that do not need frequent updates.  
âœ… **Enable signals** dynamically control when clock pulses are passed to pipeline registers.  
âœ… **If a stage has no new data, the clock signal is disabled**, reducing unnecessary transitions.  

By incorporating **clock gating**, this design achieves **lower power consumption** while maintaining the performance of a fully functional **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU**.
